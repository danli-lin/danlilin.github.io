  <h2>Steel Bridge Project - Northeastern University Steel Bridge Team</h2>
  <p>objective: to design, analyze, and fabricate a steel bridge that meets the requirements set forth by the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) for the annual ASCE Steel Bridge Competition</p>

    <p>This is the final design of the steel bridge that was fabricated and tested in the Richards Shop and in the Innovation Studio.</p>

    <p>This is a side view of the steel bridge showing the main components including the deck, bottom chord, top chord, and verticals.</p>

    <p>The RISA3D model of the steel bridge allows us to analyze each loading case given to us by the competition and optimize the bridge for most effective bridge.</p>   
    <img src="images/steelbridge/momentdiagram.jpg" alt="fabrication of steel bridge">
    <p>We cross checked our diagrams with hand calcs and our moment diagrams to ensure accuracy of our design.</p>
    <img src="images/steelbridge/Variations.jpeg" alt="fabrication of steel bridge">
    <p>We looked at the different materials, thickness, and shapes we could use and optimized our bridge by looking at the moment of inertia of each shape and the feasibility to weld these shapes.</p>

    <h2> Other ideas that were scrapped due to being overly complex, heavy or harder to execute.</h2>
