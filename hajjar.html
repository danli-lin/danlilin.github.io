        <figcaption>This is the design of steel testing set up, large actuators increase in force by displacement. We want to study the buckling behavior of the steel modules.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>I made shop drawings for each part that we required in the test setup that we did have yet in our inventory. These drawings were sent to the steel millers to produce.</figcaption>

  <h2>Hajjar Research Group - FastFloor Cross Laminated Timber Test Setup</h2>
  <p>objective: to design and detail a cross laminated timber test setup to test for uneven stress.</p>
  <img src="images/hajjar/isometric.jpg" alt="isometric view of CLT test setup">
  <p> Instead of having actuators increasing force in the y direction, we used a hydraulic system to apply force in the x direction. One actuator will push while the other pulls. One side of the clt specimen will be set on rollers while the other side is pinned.</p>
